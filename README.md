# Topic-Modeling-of-Covid19-Tweets

This exploratory study aims to the study posts on social media and microblogging sites, where individuals and communities express their opinions, feelings, and thoughts on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and social distancing to primarily understand the broader impact of social distancing compliance on their social, economic, mental, and emotional wellbeing.

It is one of the most popular topic modelling methods. Each document is made up of various words, and each topic also has various words belonging to it. (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. The aim of LDA is to find topics a document belongs to, based on the words in it.
